Specifically, bound chains and residue indexes were aligned across unbound and bound complexes.

A total of 230 binary protein complexes are included.

final/
    raw/            - List of all postprocessed (i.e. feature-enriched) pairs.

interim/
    complexes/      - List of all possible pairs in parsed.
    external_feats/ - List of all residue-level features generated using external software packages.
    pairs/          - Dill files of individual pairs listed in complexes.
    parsed/         - All DB5 structures processed to pickled dataframes.

raw/                - All pre-aligned and cleaned DB5 structures, organized into directories
                    with individual files for ligand-unbound, ligand-bound, receptor-unbound,
                    receptor-bound.
